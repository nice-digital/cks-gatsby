      "body": "A literature search was conducted in August 2017 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. There have been structural changes to the topic and a new section has been created on prognosis. Detail has been added on differentiating features of central and peripheral causes of vertigo and the alternate cover test is now included as a specific test to consider when examining a person with vertigo."
