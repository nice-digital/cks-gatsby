      "body": "A literature search was conducted in April 2017 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs and observational studies published since the last revision of the topic. New recommendations include considering use of a validated questionnaire to assess the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy; considering avoiding iron-containing preparations if they are exacerbating symptoms; and offering support in the form of self-help and support groups. There have been minor changes to the sections on when to admit or seek specialist advice; offering advice; and choice of antiemetic (the order of preference of antiemetic use). More detailed prescribing information has also been included."
