      "body": "A literature search was conducted in March 2013 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. Based on the new NICE guideline: Venous thromboembolic diseases: the management of venous thromboembolic diseases and the role of thrombophilia testing, the recommendations for the management of suspected deep vein thrombosis has been revised to include the option of giving an interim 24-hour dose of parenteral anticoagulant if a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan cannot be carried out within 4 hours of being requested. See Management of suspected DVT for more information."
