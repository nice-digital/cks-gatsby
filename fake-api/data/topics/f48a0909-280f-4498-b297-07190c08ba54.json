The lower age limit of the topic has been changed to 18 years. The recommendations on assessment have been expanded, and the management options in primary care have been amended in line with current evidence. The scenario on pregnancy and breastfeeding has been incorporated into the scenario on the management of adults with constipation. The Prescribing information section has been updated."
