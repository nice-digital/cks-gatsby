      "body": "A literature search was conducted in November 2016 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of the topic. The topic has undergone significant restructuring. The section on prescribing information has been expanded. The scope of the topic has been reduced and the information on breast lumps and vitamin D supplementation has been removed, as this is covered in detail in the CKS topics on Breast cancer - recognition and referral and Vitamin D deficiency in adults - treatment and prevention. The lower age limit of the topic has been changed from 10 to 14 years."
