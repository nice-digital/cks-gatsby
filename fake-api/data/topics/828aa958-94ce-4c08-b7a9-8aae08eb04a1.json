New recommendations have been added to the referral section, reflecting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on Suspected cancer: recognition and referral NICE, 2015. In the scenario on chronic diarrhoea, there have been changes to the assessment section and new tests to consider have been added to the recommendations on investigations."
