      "body": "A literature search was conducted in July 2016 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of the topic. There has been a change to the recommendation on timing of referral to a breast specialist to after 3 months (rather than 6 months) if pain is unresponsive to first-line treatment. There have also been minor structural changes."
