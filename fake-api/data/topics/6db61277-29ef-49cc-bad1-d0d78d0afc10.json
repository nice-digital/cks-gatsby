      "body": "A literature search was conducted in March 2019 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of this topic. No major changes to the recommendations have been made. However, the topic has undergone minor restructuring, and a prescribing information section has been added for doxycycline, which is now recommended as the first-line treatment for a person with a penicillin allergy who is also taking a statin."
