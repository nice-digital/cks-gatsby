      "title": "Revised",
      "body": "A literature search was conducted in December 2018 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. The topic now covers dog and cat bites and the scenario on pre-exposure rabies risk has been removed. There have been structural changes to streamline the scenarios. Antibiotic choices for prophylaxis and treatment of infected bite wounds have been simplified and antibiotic doses added to prescribing information. There have been changes to the recommendations on closing bite wounds in primary care."
