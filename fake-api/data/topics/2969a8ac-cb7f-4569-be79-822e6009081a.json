Changes to recommendations have been made with respect to the choice of drugs for neuropathic pain in line with the 2013 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline Neuropathic pain in adults: pharmacological management in non-specialist settings. New sections have been added on prevalence, risk factors, and differential diagnosis. Minor amendments have been made to the prescribing information section on antiviral drugs."
