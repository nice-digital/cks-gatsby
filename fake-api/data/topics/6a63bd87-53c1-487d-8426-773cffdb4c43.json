The topic has undergone significant restructuring. The recommendations on the diagnosis and management of confirmed ulcerative colitis have been amended in line with current evidence. The sections on specialist investigations and management have been updated and expanded. The Prescribing information section has been deleted and links made to other relevant CKS topics."
