      "body": "A literature search was conducted in November 2018 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of this topic. The topic has undergone minor restructuring to improve navigation, clarity, and transparency. A section on Prevalence has been added to the Background information section. The management recommendations have been updated in line with the current literature including the updated National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline Feverish illness in children: assessment and initial management in children younger than 5 years (2017)."
