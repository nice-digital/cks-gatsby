      "body": "A literature search was conducted in September 2018 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. A new section on prognosis has been added. There have been no major changes to recommendations, however, assessment, diagnostic, and management recommendations have been updated in line with the NICE Antenatal and postnatal mental health: clinical management and service guidance NICE, 2014. Detail on the risks of individual antidepressants in pregnancy and breastfeeding has been removed and links to specialist sources of information included. Prescribing information specifically relevant to antidepressants in the antenatal and postnatal period is now included in the management scenarios. General antidepressant prescribing information is available in the CKS topic on Depression."
