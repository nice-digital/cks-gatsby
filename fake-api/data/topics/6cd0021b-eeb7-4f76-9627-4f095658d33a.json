No major changes to recommendations have been made. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warning that the venous thromboembolism risk with Dianette&reg; is likely to be similar to that with Yasmin&reg; has been included in the topic MHRA, 2011. A prescribing information section for eflornithine cream has also been added."
