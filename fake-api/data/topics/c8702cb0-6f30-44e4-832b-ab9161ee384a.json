      "body": "A literature search was conducted in October 2017 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of the topic. The topic has undergone minor restructuring. The recommendations on the diagnosis and management of psoriasis have been amended in line with current evidence. An additional node has been added to the Management section on Specialist investigations and treatment. The section on Topical corticosteroids has been removed from the Prescribing information section, and replaced with links to the CKS topic on Corticosteroids - topical (skin), nose, and eyes."
