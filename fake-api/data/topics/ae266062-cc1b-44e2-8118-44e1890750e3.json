The topic has been updated in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline Chronic kidney disease. Early identification and management of chronic kidney disease in adults in primary and secondary care (2015). The topic has undergone minor restructuring to improve navigation and clarity. The topic has been renamed &#39;Chronic kidney disease&#39; and information on the management of people with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease has been added to the section on Management in primary care. An Assessment node has been added to the section on Diagnosis. The prescribing information section has been updated."
