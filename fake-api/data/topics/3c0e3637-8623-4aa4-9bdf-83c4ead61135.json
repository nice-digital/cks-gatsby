      "body": "A literature search was conducted in April 2014 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of this topic. No major changes have been made to the recommendations; however, fondaparinux has now been included as a drug option for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in people with superficial thrombophlebitis who are judged to be at increased risk of a DVT. Additional sections on the prognosis and complications of superficial thrombophlebitis as well as antibiotics prescribing information have also been added."
