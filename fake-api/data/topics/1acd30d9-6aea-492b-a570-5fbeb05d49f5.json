      "body": "A literature search was conducted in October 2013 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. New sections have been written on recovery-orientated drug treatment, the QTc interval, detection of drugs in the urine, and the management of acute and chronic pain. Minor changes have been made to the recommendations. Methadone is now recommended for detoxification from street heroin."
