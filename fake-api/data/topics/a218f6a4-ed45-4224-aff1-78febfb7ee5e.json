      "body": "A literature search was conducted in February 2015 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of this topic. No major changes to recommendations have been made. However, the topic has been restructured for clarity, prescribing information sections for the recommended anti-emetics have been added, and the title of the topic has been changed (from renal colic to renal or ureteric colic) to reflect the fact that ureteric colic is a more clinically accurate term for the condition."
