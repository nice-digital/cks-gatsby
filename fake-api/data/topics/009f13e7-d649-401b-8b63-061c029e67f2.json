No major changes to the recommendations have been made. However, recommendations in the Acute otitis media - initial presentation and Persistent acute otitis media - treatment failure scenarios have been updated in line with the 2018 NICE guideline Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing, and individual prescribing information sections for the recommended antibiotics have been added."
