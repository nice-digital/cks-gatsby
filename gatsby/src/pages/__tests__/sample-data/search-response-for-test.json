Vertigo can adversely affect quality of life and independence and affect activities such as driving and employment. Vertigo also increases the likelihood of falls and anxiety. Most balance problems that present in primary care are not true rotatory vertigo. It is important to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo.Peripheral vertigo is more common and is usually caused by a problem with the&nbsp;inner ear affecting the labyrinth or vestibular nerve&nbsp;(for example&nbsp;benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, and Meniere&rsquo;s disease). Central vertigo is uncommon and is usually&nbsp;caused by pathology in the brainstem and cerebellum (for example&nbsp;stroke, transient ischaemic attack, cerebellar tumour, and multiple sclerosis).   Examination should include looking for facial asymmetry, examination of the ear, testing of cranial nerves and cerebellar function, examination of the eyes, and checking for signs of peripheral neuropathy and abnormal gait. Specific tests such as Romberg&rsquo;s test, the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre, the head impulse test, Unterberger&rsquo;s test and the alternate cover test can give useful information on the origin of vertigo. If peripheral vertigo is suspected, the history and examination findings can be used to differentiate between conditions, in particular benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuronitis and labyrinthitis, and Meniere&#39;s disease. A central cause of vertigo should be suspected when the signs and symptoms do not match the features of any of the peripheral causes with reasonable accuracy.Features increasing suspicion of a central cause of vertigo include prolonged, severe vertigo; new-onset headache or recent trauma; focal neurological signs and symptoms; central-type nystagmus; an abnormal response to the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre; and an inability to stand up or walk even with the eyes open.   Management of vertigo will depend on the suspected underlying cause and associated clinical findings.&nbsp;It may include admission to hospital&nbsp;if there are worrying features, or referral to a specialist for confirmation of the diagnosis.\",\"feedertype\":\"pfeeders\",\"published_date\":\"2017-12-01T12:00:00\",\"source_name\":\"CKS\"},\"highlight\":{\"content\":[\"gait.

Refractory coeliac disease is the persistence or recurrence of otherwise unexplained malabsorptive symptoms and villous atrophy despite adhering to a gluten-free diet. In the UK population, screening studies suggest that 1 in 100 people are affected. Complications of coeliac disease include anaemia, osteoporosis, splenic dysfunction, bacterial overgrowth, and cancer such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Coeliac disease should be suspected and serology testing should be offered to a person with: Persistent, unexplained abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms. Faltering growth in children.Â  Prolonged fatigue. Unexpected weight loss. Severe or persistent mouth ulcers. Unexplained iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Autoimmune thyroid disease. Irritable bowel syndrome in adults. A first-degree relative with coeliac disease.  Serology testing for coeliac disease should be considered in a person with any of the following: Metabolic bone disorder such as osteomalacia or reduced bone mineral density. Unexplained peripheral neuropathy or ataxia. Unexplained recurrent miscarriage or subfertility. Persistently raised liver function tests with unknown cause. Dental enamel defects. Down's syndrome or Turner syndrome.  Blood samples should be sent for coeliac disease serology in children and young people: immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) and total IgA first-line.Â  IgA endomysial antibody (EMA) can be used if IgA tTGA is unavailable, or in cases where it is weakly positive.  Referral to a paediatrician for testing should be considered in younger children, unless the expertise is available in primary care.Â  If the test is positive, the young person or adult should be referred to a gastroenterologist for endoscopy and biopsy of the small intestine. Children should be referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist for further investigation. The only effective treatment for coeliac disease is long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet.Â  People with confirmed coeliac disease should be reviewed annually, and this should include: Providing adequate information and advice on coeliac disease and the gluten-free diet. Assessment of adherence to a varied, nutritious gluten-free diet. Assessment for symptoms and signs of coeliac disease, its complications and associated conditions. Annual coeliac serology testing and routine blood tests, if indicated. Offering immunizations, if indicated, for example for people with splenic dysfunction. Referral to a gastroenterologist (or paediatric gastroenterologist) if there is any of the following: faltering growth in a child; symptoms and signs suggestive of gastrointestinal cancer; complications, persistent symptoms and signs of coeliac disease despite adhering to a gluten-free diet. Referral to a dietitian if there is difficulty in assessing adherence to a gluten-free diet, or if poor adherence to a gluten-free diet is suspected.\",\"feedertype\":\"pfeeders\",\"published_date\":\"2016-10-01T12:00:00\",\"source_name\":\"CKS\"},\"highlight\":{\"content\":[\"recurrent miscarriage or subfertility.

Functional dyspepsia (also known as non-ulcer dyspepsia) refers to people with dyspepsia symptoms and normal findings on endoscopy (gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastric malignancy, or oesophagitis have&nbsp;been excluded).Functional dyspepsia is the most common diagnosis when endoscopy is performed to investigate&nbsp;dyspepsia symptoms.   Two sub-types of&nbsp;functional dyspepsia have been defined, which can overlap:Epigastric pain syndrome, where intermittent or burning pain is localized to the epigastrium. Post-prandial distress syndrome, where there is post-prandial fullness or early satiety.   The cause of functional dyspepsia&nbsp;remains uncertain and is likely to be multifactorial. If left untreated, at least 70% of people with functional dyspepsia will have persistent symptoms one year after diagnosis, and the lifetime risk of recurrence is about 50%.
