Causes of late walking include neuromuscular diseases, neurological disorders, hypermobility, and developmental hip dysplasia. Growing pains&nbsp;&mdash; one of the most common causes of recurrent musculoskeletal pain in children.&nbsp;Typical findings include&nbsp;bilateral pain in the lower extremities&nbsp;occurring late in the day or during the night. Out-toeing&nbsp;&mdash; describes lateral or external rotation of the foot relative to the direction in which the child is moving.&nbsp;It is normal in early infancy, usually resolving by 18&ndash;24 months of age. Tip-toe walking&nbsp;&mdash; when a child walks predominantly on their toes or forefoot, with absent heel strike. It is common in children up to 3 years of age.   Although some presentations may be appropriately managed in the community, it is important to be aware of red flags when assessing a child or young person with a musculoskeletal problem as these may require admission or urgent referral. Admission to an emergency department should be arranged for children with:Suspected septic arthritis. Suspected osteomyelitis. Suspected fracture. Suspected slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE).

Refractory coeliac disease is the persistence or recurrence of otherwise unexplained malabsorptive symptoms and villous atrophy despite adhering to a gluten-free diet. In the UK population, screening studies suggest that 1 in 100 people are affected. Complications of coeliac disease include anaemia, osteoporosis, splenic dysfunction, bacterial overgrowth, and cancer such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Assessment of adherence to a varied, nutritious gluten-free diet. Assessment for symptoms and signs of coeliac disease, its complications and associated conditions. Annual coeliac serology testing and routine blood tests, if indicated. Offering immunizations, if indicated, for example for people with splenic dysfunction. Referral to a gastroenterologist (or paediatric gastroenterologist) if there is any of the following: faltering growth in a child; symptoms and signs suggestive of gastrointestinal cancer; complications, persistent symptoms and signs of coeliac disease despite adhering to a gluten-free diet.

Morton&#39;s neuroma is considered to be a common condition in primary care. The mean age at presentation is 55 years. It is 4&ndash;15 times more common in women than in men.
